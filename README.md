# Optima

Optima is a C++ library for numerical solution of linear and nonlinear programing problems. Optima is mainly developed in C++ for performance reasons. A Python interface is available for a more convenient and simpler use of the scientific library. 

Optima is still under development, and its API can change at any time. The algorithms are mature enough, but the way the optimization problems are defined will most likely change (and be simplified).
